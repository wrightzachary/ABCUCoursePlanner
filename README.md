Project One and Project Two CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
<br>

Project one we were tasked with providing pseudocode and a run-time analysis for the application we would then create in project two. Our pseudocode was also about three different data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. In our run time analysis we were also tasked with making an educated guess, based off of previous milestones and assignments, to what data structure we would use for project Two. I selected vector data structure to complete project two

<br>
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
<br>

To complete the problem we were tasked to solve, I broke down the problem into smaller pieces. For project one, I focused on the pseudocode one methd at a time for each data structure. The from here I went into my advantages and disadvanteges. Next I rolled into the run-time analysis and finally made an eductaed assumption on what would be the best the best data structure to use. For project two, I took the same approach, first creating the menu, then loading the cvs path, then adding the data from csv file into the vector, then finally printing the data from the vecotr accorindly to match the menu options.

<br>
- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
<br>

I faced a one problem from what I attempted on project two and that was printing specific data from the vector from the specific course that the user wishes to view. The reason I believe I had this issue was becuase I was overcomplecating it. With a background in JavaScript, I kept trying to access it like an array. I relaized that I could utilize a search method to find the course number in the vector then use a nested loop to print that course.

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
<br>

Project one and two really made me re-evaulate how I approached projects. Noramlly, I would take a quick look at the requirements then knock out the assignment but for these two projects I really had to read and understand the rubric. I think these projects really set a tone on the why and how I need to design software for the rest of my CS degree, also in my career.

<br>
- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
<br>
Previously I have been notorious to code with minimal comments in my school work, this course has helped me understand the importance in comments throughout the code to help navigate for easier reading. Project two also helped me work on spliting up individual tasks into different methods.
